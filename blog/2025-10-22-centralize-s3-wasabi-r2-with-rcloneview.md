# One App to Rule Them All: Centralize Amazon S3, Wasabi, and Cloudflare R2 with RcloneView

> Bring all your object-storage clouds under one roof—without touching the command line.

## Why centralize S3-compatible storage across Amazon, Wasabi, and Cloudflare R2?

If you’re working with large volumes of data or managing multi-cloud backups, you know that storage isn’t one-size-fits-all.  
- **Amazon S3** offers global scale and maturity.  
- **Wasabi** provides cost-efficient, high-capacity storage.  
- **Cloudflare R2** eliminates egress fees for distribution workloads.

The catch? Each has its own console, API, and toolset. That’s where **RcloneView** steps in.  
By layering a modern GUI over the proven **rclone engine**, it unifies your S3, Wasabi, and R2 storage into a **single interface**—so you can manage, compare, and automate cross-cloud transfers with ease.

**RcloneView gives you:**
- One dashboard for multiple S3-compatible endpoints  
- Visual file browser for drag-and-drop transfers  
- Preview and compare before syncing  
- Job scheduling and automation with history tracking  

In short: if you rely on any combination of **S3**, **Wasabi**, or **R2**, you can now treat them as one cohesive storage fabric.

## Understanding the three players

**Amazon S3**
- The market leader for scalability and integration.  
- Ideal for production workloads, analytics, and app hosting.  
- Costs can rise with egress or retrieval from deep tiers.

**Wasabi**
- S3-compatible storage at a fraction of the cost.  
- Perfect for cold or archival data.  
- Simple pricing—no egress surprises.

**Cloudflare R2**
- Newer player with an S3 API and zero-egress-fee advantage.  
- Best for content delivery, backups, or data-sharing workflows.  
- Globally distributed through Cloudflare’s network.

Together, these services enable a layered storage strategy:  
**hot data → S3**, **archival → Wasabi**, **distribution → R2**.  
RcloneView is the missing piece that connects them.

## Step 1 – Preparation

Before starting:

1. **Map your sources and targets** — identify which buckets or folders you want to sync.  
2. **Check permissions** — ensure each API key has read/write access.  
3. **Plan your workflows** — replication, archiving, or distribution.  
4. **Estimate cost impacts** — especially for retrieval or API requests.  
5. **Test with small datasets** — verify settings before scaling up.

## Step 2 – Add your S3-compatible remotes in RcloneView

RcloneView makes multi-provider setup straightforward:

1. Launch **RcloneView** → click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Choose the correct backend type:  
   - **Amazon S3** — use your region and access keys.  
   - **Wasabi** — set endpoint (`s3.wasabisys.com`) and credentials.  
   - **Cloudflare R2** — set endpoint (`https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`) and keys.  
3. Name each clearly (e.g., `S3_Prod`, `Wasabi_Archive`, `R2_Distribution`).  
4. Confirm connectivity—each remote should appear in the left pane’s Explorer.

## Step 3 – Transfer and sync across providers

RcloneView supports multiple workflows for S3, Wasabi, and R2:

### A) **Drag & Drop**
- Open two remotes (e.g., `S3_Prod` → `Wasabi_Archive`).  
- Drag folders from source to destination.  
- Ideal for quick or one-time transfers.

  <img src="/support/images/en/tutorials/wasabi-drag-and-drop.png" alt="drag and drop" class="img-large img-center" />

### B) **Compare & Copy**
- Use **Compare** to preview object differences before syncing.  
- Copy only changed files to reduce API calls and transfer times.

### C) **Sync & Schedule**
- Automate full bucket mirrors (e.g., nightly Wasabi backups from S3).  
- Run a **Dry Run** to confirm first.  
- Save as a reusable **Job** and schedule execution.

## Step 4 – Pro tips for smoother operations

- **Name remotes and jobs descriptively** (e.g., `S3→Wasabi_DailyBackup`).  
- Always **Dry Run** before syncing large datasets.  
- **Monitor egress and API usage**—some tiers charge per request.  
- Use **Job History** to audit and troubleshoot syncs.  
- Leverage RcloneView’s **Compare Mode** before big merges.

## Conclusion — Simplify multi-cloud storage management

**Why it matters:**  
- One GUI to manage all S3-compatible clouds.  
- Streamlined syncs between Amazon S3, Wasabi, and Cloudflare R2.  
- Automation and visibility for every job.  

**How it works:**  
1. Add remotes.  
2. Preview and sync.  
3. Automate recurring jobs.  
All visually—no `rclone` command lines required.

## FAQs

**Q. Can I sync Wasabi → Cloudflare R2 directly?**  
**A.** Yes. Once both are added as remotes, you can transfer in either direction.

**Q. Do scheduled jobs run if RcloneView is closed?**  
**A.** Jobs run as long as the RcloneView background service is active.

**Q. Is there any cost to transferring between providers?**  
**A.** Yes, depending on each provider’s egress and request pricing. Always verify before large moves.

**Q. What if I already use rclone CLI?**  
**A.** RcloneView uses the same configuration—your existing remotes can be imported automatically.
