### Method 2: Compare, then copy or delete

1. Open the source folder in Yandex Disk (left) and target folder in Google Drive (right).
2. Select **Compare**.
3. RcloneView will highlight:
   - Items present only on one side
   - Items that differ in size
   - Matching files
4. Click **Copy →** or **← Copy** depending on direction.
5. Use **Delete** carefully when cleaning up duplicates.

### Method 3: Sync or save as a Job

1. Select a **Yandex folder** as the source and a **Google Drive folder** as the destination.
2. Click **Sync**.
3. Choose:
   - One-way sync (Yandex → Google Drive)
   - One-way sync (Google Drive → Yandex)
   - Two-way sync
4. Preview the planned operations using dry-run.
5. Run the sync, or click **Save to Jobs** to reuse it later.

## Tips for smooth transfers

- Use **dry-run** before large one-way syncs.
- Google Drive API may throttle very large bursts; reduce concurrency if needed.
- Keep RcloneView running for scheduled Jobs.
